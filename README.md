Mcabber Slack Autocompletion
============================

Default mcabber setup can't complete names starting with `@`. That module adds
to completion list all users with leading `@` so they can be autocompleted and
two special names: `@channel` and `@everyone`.

## Installation

Package available in the AUR:
https://aur4.archlinux.org/packackes/mcabber-modules-slack-completion.

## Usage

Just add following lines to your mcabber config:

```
module load slack_autocompletion
```
